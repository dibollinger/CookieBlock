# CookieBlock

Repository for the CookieBlock browser extension, which automatically enforces user privacy policy on browser cookies.

It is compatible with both Firefox and Chromium-based browsers.

## Description

__CookieBlock__ is an extension that allows the user to apply their cookie consent preferences to any website, no matter if the website has a cookie banner. The user specifies their consent options once when the extension is first installed, and then CookieBlock will try to remove any cookies that do not align with the user's policy as they are being created.

It offers the following features:
* Automatic classification of cookies into distinct purpose categories.
* Enforcement of a user's privacy policy by filtering cookie categories that have been rejected by the user.
* A choice of which consent categories to block, with an informative description being provided for each category.
* Defining website exceptions, such that all cookies that arrive through that website are accepted.

This is intended to ensure that the privacy of the user is preserved. One can reject any of the following categories:
* Functionality Cookies
* Analytical/Statistics Cookies
* Advertising/Tracking Cookies

Note that CookieBlock does not handle the cookie banner itself. In order to remove these annoying banners, we recommend using the Consent-O-Matic extension, or similar addons:
